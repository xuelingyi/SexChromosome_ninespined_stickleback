This repository stores the scripts and codes used in the study "Sex chromosome turnover in hybridizing stickleback lineages" published in Evolution Letters (https://academic.oup.com/evlett/advance-article/doi/10.1093/evlett/qrae019/7670581). Please cite this paper as the reference. 

In this study, we first identified sex chromosomes and the sex-determining region (SDR) in the Western European lineage (WL) of nine-spined sticklebacks using four family crosses (1. WL_SDR_familyData). Second, we identified the genetic sex of 887 wild-caught individuals and characterized sex chromosome diversity across 45 populations (2. wild_dataset). Lastly, we focused on the marine populations in the Baltic Sea hybrid zone where a sex chromosome turnover was indicated (3. marine).
